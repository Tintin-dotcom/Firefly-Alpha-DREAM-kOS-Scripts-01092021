# Firefly-Alpha-DREAM-kOS-Scripts-01092021

Craft files for the rocket, and a version without the parts needed for kOS, are included.

Link to Youtube video:


This is the Kerbal Operating System code for a Firefly Alpha launch, carrying the DREAM mission to LEO.

The code launches the mission into LEO, deployes all the payloads and the Spinnaker-3 Dragsail.

The boot.ks file opens the kOS Terminal of the kOS processor directly after launching the vessel. This only works if you right-click the kOS processor attached to the launcher's faring base, and select boot file "boot.ks". This file has to be placed inside a "Boot" foder in the KSP/Ships/Script directory.

///NOTES///

-> Tested in Kerbal Space Program Version 1.12.2.
